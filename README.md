# OPPORTUNITYBOARD

We're working on a redesign of the current opportunity board website exclusively available to students at African Leadership University. The existing platform, which is built with canvas, has received complaints from numerous students and alumni. Our aim with this new website is to enhance the user experience and make opportunities more accessible to the community.

4. Create an `.env` file from the `.env.template` file (copy everything in the `.env.template` file and put it in the `.env` file with appropriate values).

   - `POSTGRES_URI` is the `connection string` which you'll get from mongodb [for reference](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/).
   - `GOOGLEAUTH_SECRET` Just pass any `random string` or you can quickly create a good value on the command line via this `openssl command`.

   ```sh
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```

5. Run docker container
   ```sh
   docker compose up
   ```
